# üè® Continental Hotel

This project is a basic concept of a Hotel Reservation Platform designed to streamline the process of booking hotel rooms. It for clients to, create accounts on the platform, reserve rooms and manage their reservations, with a possibility for payment gateway integration.

## Features

- User Authentication: The platform provides a secure login system for users. They can create an account, log in, and manage their personal information on a `UserProfile` model.
- Reservation Management: Users can make new reservations, view their existing reservations, or cancel them as per their convenience on `Room` and `Reservation` models.
- Payment Gateway Integration: The platform is integrated with a secure payment gateway for users to make payments for their reservations.

## Future Enhancements

- Proper/Better execution of payment gateway integrations for a seamless plug-and-play integration with any payment service. Will need work with consuming APIs.
- Better user interface. I do backend but would be nice to dabble on FrontEnd.
